<h2>Adaptive table writen in AppKit</h2>

**What do you mean by adaptive table?**

I started this project to get acquainted with AppKit a little bit more and as well to understand how to get rid of ridicoluos Inteface Builder views in some of the projects I participate in.
So what I want to achieve?
I want to build a UI component that utilizes NSTableView and can be used as a container for heterogenous NSTableViewCells.
This component should be easily adjusted to the provided list of cell views.
Well, it should resemble SwiftUI list in terms of ability to setup cells without getting snowed under MVC spaggetti.
